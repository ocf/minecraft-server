      "desc:8": "For this part we will learn how to use our adapter, place it next to, let\u0027s say your EBFs battery buffer and connect it to the computer with cables.\nNow lets type in lua while on the computer to open the LUA environment where we can test things without worrying about saving and trying our program.\n\nType in \u0027component.list()\u0027 this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we\u0027re looking for is gt_batterybuffer.\nIf you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.\n\nSo now assign a variable to it; for example \u0027a \u003d component.gt_batterybuffer\u0027; now we can call \u0027a\u0027 to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.\nWhat we\u0027ll be using in this example is the \u0027getBatteryCharge\u0027 method. So type  \u0027a.getBatteryCharge(1)\u0027 this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.\n\nSo if we\u0027re using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, \u0027for i\u003d1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end\u0027\nPoof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?\n\nTry making a variable called \u0027batteryCharge \u003d 0\u0027, now do \u0027for i\u003d1, 4 do batteryCharge \u003d batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end\u0027\n\nNow print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here\u0027s a program example of this being used.\n\nPlace in your tape drive and type \u0027install\u0027, and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.\n\nI suppose that\u0027s enough for now; congrats! Experiment and learn, and don\u0027t forget to check google as much as possible!  \nThis questline will be updated again in the future; but I figure this is a good ending point for now."
