A locking track will stop the train as long as oil is loaded or unloaded.\n\n[note]PS: You should probably use the Long Distance Fluid Pipeline once you can make it in LV unless you really love trains.[/note]\n\nFull details on how to use these may require online research (GTNH changes the recipes, not normal Railcraft functionality), but here is a simple list of things to do:\n\n1. Make a loop of track from your base to the oil well.\n2. Place a locking track near the well, and put a fluid loader two blocks above it. The track should be in Locking Mode - use a crowbar to change it.\n3. Use the tank car on the filter in the loader and set it to Immediate mode.\n4. Connect the well to the loader as normal.\n5. Put a fluid unloader under a locking track at your base, and set it the same as the loader.\n6. Automate the locomotive similarly - a fluid loader above a steam locomotive set to manual and filtered to the locomotive.\n\nEither you got it working, you need to do more research, you realized it moves 32 buckets a trip and decided to just walk, or you can go to Discord and ask why anyone would build a train.\n\nItem loaders also exist, but the main use for them may be to refuel your locomotive."
