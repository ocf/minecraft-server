It does work better at higher tiers and lasts longer with better materials.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t make a convenient book like the Seismic Prospector, but you can look at the results of scanning on the map, thanks to Visual Prospecting.\n\nIt can be hard to choose a good material for the Basic Prospector. Here are some good choices for you in their respective tiers, the size searched, and the average amount of veins they can scan:\n\nLV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 50\nMV Vanadiumsteel 3x3 - 213\nHV Vibrant Alloy 5x5 - 299\nEV Shadow Metal 7x7 - 1080\nIV Oriharukon 7x7 - 2649\n\nAs you can see, the prospectors become better and better with each tier, but it might also be worth looking around for better materials.\n\nGood luck."
