Remember that NEI bookmarks are your friends.\n\nThe GT tools each have special uses.\n\nScrewdriver - Used on covers to change their behavior.\n\nWrench - Used to change the output direction on a GT machine, or to break it. Can also disconnect/connect pipes or enable their built in shutter.\n\nCrowbar - Remove covers from machines or pipes.\n\nWire cutters - Connecting/disconnecting/breaking wires/cables.\n\nSoft mallet - Turning machines on/off.\n\nHammer - Prospecting for ores in a limited way in front of you, and smashing ore blocks into crushed ores.\n\nOn a side note, Tin Pipes need a Steel Wrench to dismantle, so don\u0027t place them randomly."
