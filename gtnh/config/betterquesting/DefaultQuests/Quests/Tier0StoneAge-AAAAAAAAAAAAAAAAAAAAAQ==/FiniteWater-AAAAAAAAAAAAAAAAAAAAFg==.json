If you can drink cacti, you should also be able make water out of 8 cacti and use that for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade? 10 wood for... 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?\n\nTo automate the farm, place a string next to the cactus and a sand on top of the string. Now when the cactus grows, it will automatically break!  You can stack this horizontally and vertically to make a very efficient cactus farm.  Use water to redirect the cactus to a convenient pickup location or to above a hopper.\n\nFirst player to make a base running off of only cactus water gets a cape!"
