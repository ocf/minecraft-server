However veins generate extra small ores related to the vein in their chunks, so they can still be useful in your search (though not all small ores are related to a nearby vein so don\u0027t be fooled).[/note]\n\n[note]Another great interaction is that you can use the NEI search bar in highlight mode (doubleclick it) and then go to the map screen to get the matching uncovered ore veins highlighted![/note]"
