And making explosives too.\n\nCompress the cobblestone in an assembler first with circuit 1, then run them through the Implosion Compressor until you get Quadruple Compressed Cobblestone. Do that four times, and then another pass through the assembler with a diamond block, and there you have it - one bedrockium ingot.\n\nNow do that 5 more times, and you can make yourself a bedrockium drum.\n\n64k buckets of portable fluid. Perfect for your new Ore drill!\n\n[note]There\u0027s also a Bedrockium ore much later on if you\u0027re lazy. By then you probably won\u0027t want the drums though.[/note]"
