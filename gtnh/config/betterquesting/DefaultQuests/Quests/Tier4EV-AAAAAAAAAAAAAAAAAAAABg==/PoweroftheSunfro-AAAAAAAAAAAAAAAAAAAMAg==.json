      "desc:8": "Your good old singleblock Molecular Transformer is gone. So how to obtain Sunnarium? Well there are couple of ways, but at EV you\u0027ll need to radiate Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.\n\nThe Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is `(number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)` per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.\n\nAs you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren\u0027t charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely. In any case, if you just wish to charge it up FAST then here is a possible string for the IC2 Reactor Planner:\n\nerp\u003dbpO50cpsdtJElVqn4hObFJc0tiOE0JpEHYpqTxJHvyezjSKRjUuwgouXzNOlU4a3hFBRygM\u003d\n\nReplace Containment Reactor Plating with actual Glowstone rods and you should be good to go. You can also use fewer reactor chambers by using less plating. Enjoy!"
