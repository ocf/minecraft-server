With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let\u0027s trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.\n\nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You\u0027ll get Witchery seeds too - save those for later. \n\nStart planting a Cotton field because it\u0027s a key early-game resource.\n\nYou can also get seeds from villages, and grow the seeds from the Pam\u0027s garden food."
