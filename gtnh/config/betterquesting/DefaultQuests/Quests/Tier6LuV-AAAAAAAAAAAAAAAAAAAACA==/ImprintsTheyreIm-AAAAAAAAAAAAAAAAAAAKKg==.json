You\u0027ll need to slice the circuits for the imprint in either a tier-appropriate slicing machine, or the Cutting Factory in slicing mode.\n\nTo use the imprints, place them in the CAL controller\u0027s item slot. The CAL will be imprinted once you turn it on. You can see what it\u0027s imprinted with by using a portable scanner on the controller. You can also swap out controllers if you\u0027re too lazy to make more CALs.\n\n[note]If you already have an imprint for an earlier version of a recipe, you don\u0027t need to make another, it works with both recipes.[/note]"
