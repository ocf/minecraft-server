So what if they\u0027re nearly full? You want to know what they\u0027re nearly full §oof§r.\n\nTally Boxes can be pointed at a container - either directly or, using a Remote Comparator, remotely - and given a Runic Whitelist that specifies conditions where you want a Tally Box to send a redstone signal. Quantity, metadata and NBT matching are options, as is using a basic name filter.\n\nNote that the redstone side is always opposite the reading side, and Remote Comparators must be placed on top of Tally Boxes to work together, meaning redstone is always output on the down face in that case.\n\n[note]Runic Whitelists don\u0027t let you use NEI ghost items to set their filters, unfortunately.[/note]"
