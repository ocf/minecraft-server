You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.\n\nKeep in mind a \u0027bare\u0027 pure node won\u0027t change anything unless it has Victus. You can try use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in \u0027Magical\u0027 type biomes."
