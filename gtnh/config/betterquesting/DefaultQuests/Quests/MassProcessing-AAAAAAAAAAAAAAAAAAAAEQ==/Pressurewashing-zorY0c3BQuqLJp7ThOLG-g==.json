Since these are quite dirty, you will have to clean them up to get certain byproducts. But how do you clean up this multitude of crushed ores? By using a Steam Purifier, of course! With a steady flow of Steam and a bit of Water, you can wash away impurities and get Purified Crushed Ores in no time.\n\nIf you\u0027re tired of waiting forever for your ores to clean up, this is your fix!\n\nÂ§3This Multiblock has two modes, the default Washer Mode and a Simple Washer Mode. Simple Washers process ores considerably faster, but they do not give byproducts. Like other Multiblocks, the mode can be toggled by the respective button inside the GUI or by right-clicking the Controller with a Screwdriver. Since all ore washing recipes are LV, this Multiblock can run all of them."
