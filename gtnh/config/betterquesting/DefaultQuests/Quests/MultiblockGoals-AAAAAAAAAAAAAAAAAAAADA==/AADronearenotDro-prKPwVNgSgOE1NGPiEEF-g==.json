These new electric friends are great companions for MultiBlock machines: maintenance, control, management—they can do it all.\n\n§lThe Drone Center is a newly designed machine. It doesn\u0027t need power; just put a drone into it and then it will run.\nOnce running, drone will automatically scan for a \u0027§lDrone Downlink Module§r\u0027 (replacing maintenance hatches on MultiBlock machines) within a certain range and attempt to establish a connection with the host. If successful, you can remotely control this MultiBlock machine from the Drone Centre GUI! Additionally, you can rename the machine for easier identification.\n\n[note]You can rename it either by right-click the Drone Downlink Module or in Drone Centre GUI.[/note]\n\nPlacing more advanced drones will increase the range of central control, with no limit on the number.\n\n[warn]Notice that drone may crash during operation—the probability decreases from Tier 1 to Tier 3, and Tier 3 Anti-Gravity Drones never crash.\nBesides, If the machine host is too far from the Drone Center, the GUI remote control function will be disabled, but the turn-on/off-all-button and maintenance functions will still work.[/warn]\n§6§l\nMaybe one day, our drone can control machines on other planets...drive engine online!"
