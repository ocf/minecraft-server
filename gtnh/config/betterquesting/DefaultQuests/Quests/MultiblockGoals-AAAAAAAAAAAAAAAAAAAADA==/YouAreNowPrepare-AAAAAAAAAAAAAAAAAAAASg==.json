Time for some casting!\n\nThe aluminium oreberries can be planted on cropsticks, and macerated to get small quantites of aluminium for molds if you can\u0027t find aluminium gravel.\n\nNote: The book says a 3x3 base, but you can make a smeltery with a smaller base. Taller/wider smelteries can do more items at one time, conserving fuel.\n\n[note]The smeltery does not double ores in GTNH. Later machines will help you there.[/note]"
