It is incredibly stable even at extreme temperatures, but this also made it unable to pack together for coils.\n\nHowever, the situation changed when you thought about using something more intelligent. By integrating a Wetware or better UHV circuit, the Infinity Coil became a reality, controlled by the ever-watching eyes of the circuitry you\u0027ve spent months to create. From now on, these eyes will watch over your multiblocks.\n\nProvides 11701K heat. You could upgrade your EBF, though at this point it\u0027s more likely to be for your MEBFs or your DTPF."
