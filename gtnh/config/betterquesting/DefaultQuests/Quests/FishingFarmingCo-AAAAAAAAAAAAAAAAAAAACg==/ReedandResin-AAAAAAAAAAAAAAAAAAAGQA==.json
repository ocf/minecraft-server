It\u0027s also great for crossing with other crops to raise their stats. One of the best strategies is to get these to around 20/31/10, then breed out from there. Most people will say 23/31/10, but 24+ act like weeds, so it\u0027s better to have some wiggle room.\n\nI\u0027ll trade you some fertilizer for 2 stacks of each.\n\n[note]PS, you don\u0027t really need rubber trees if you can get these.[/note]\n\n[note]You\u0027ll need a Basic Scanner to scan your Stickreed seeds once you get them, though any set of stats will work. See the quest in LV, and note it requires MV circuits.[/note]"
