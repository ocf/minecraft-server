All blocks connected to the kitchen floor (use it as walls too!) are considered part of the same multiblock. Countertops will search up two blocks for cabinets to include.\n\nItems stored in storages like the cabinet (or your inventory) can be used in recipes. All storage spaces for items are the same, so don\u0027t bother making a ton of fridges unless you really want to. Supply water to the sink to get water for recipes.\n\nYou can store some cooking tools in the oven. You can store the rest on tool racks to auto-use them all in recipes. This includes stuff like the GT soft mallet if you can\u0027t make all the Pam\u0027s tools yet.\n\nThe oven has 3 input slots and 3 output slots, and can work on 9 items at once. It\u0027s basically a furnace. You can request items be cooked from the cooking table too.\n\nThe Cooking Table will automatically show you all recipes that can be created with the existing ingredients, and you can click on them to craft them. Make all the food, and get all the hearts!\n\nYou can use dye to color the kitchen, except for the oven.\n\nNote that the implementation is not finished, so there are some problems. Upgrades like powering the oven with RF/EU are not in yet. And so on. But we finally have a toaster so you can make TOAST!\n\nPlease report any bugs/problems to the CFB-specific GTNH issue tracker at [url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/CookingForBlockheads/issues[/url]\n\n[note]There is no cow in a jar, it will not come back.[/note]"
