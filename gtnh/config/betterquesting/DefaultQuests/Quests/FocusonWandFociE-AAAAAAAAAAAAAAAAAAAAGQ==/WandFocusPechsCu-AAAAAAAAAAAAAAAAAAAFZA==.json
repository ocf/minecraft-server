(If attacked, the Pech will use it against you!)  Its vis cost per shot is 0.1 Perditio, 0.1 Terra and 0.1 Aqua.\n\nThe focus fires a small ball of energy with a bright bluish-green trail. This missile is affected by gravity, so the shots need to be \"arced\" to hit distant targets. When the shot hits a mob, it does one heart of damage and randomly inflicts one of several effects on the target: Poison, Weakness, or Slowness. A 5th-level upgrade to the focus can make it give all the effects at once.\n\nThis focus can be upgraded at the Focal Manipulator."
