A small reward is in order!\n\nThe [note]Infinite Spray Can[/note] never runs out of paint, and contains all sixteen colors (as well as solvent!) Of course, line mode and Ring of Loki support are included. There are also many convenience features. Middle click to open a color choice GUI. Middle click a painted block to copy its color to the spray can. Left click to cycle the active color (sneak to go backwards.) Sneak middle click to lock the can; while locked, you can\u0027t accidentally change the color. Sneak middle click to unlock. \n\nNaturally, you\u0027ll have to craft the infinite spray can yourself. It\u0027s a Dire Crafting recipe, so hopefully you have a dire crafting table. It requires a lot of platinum line materials, of course. And, apparently, a rainbow cactus, so a small detour into magic will be necessary. And a bunch of random-looking AE2 parts. And an IV world accelerator. And... a fence?\n\nIs this really a reward?"
