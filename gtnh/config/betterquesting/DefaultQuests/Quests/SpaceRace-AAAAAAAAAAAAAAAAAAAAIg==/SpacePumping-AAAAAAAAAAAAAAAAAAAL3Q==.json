By constructing the \"Planetary Gas Siphon\" multiblock, you are able to pump from the infinite supply of gas found on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You just need to build a space station around a gas planet to get close enough to reach the gas without falling into it.\n\nDifferent gases can be extracted by pumping at different depths which is controlled by a Programmed Circuit. You need to supply (64 * depth) Mining Pipes to reach the selected depth.\n\nWhile operational, the multiblock needs d*4^(T+2) EU/t where T is the tier of the space station and d is the depth.\n\nYou can find an overview of what you can pump and where in the Tips and Tricks chapter."
