If you dont have one yet, you should have a look at it. It has 4 separate tier system and might be a bit over whelming at first, but there is a minecraft book that can tell you everything about it. Also check out the quest for the Chemical Plant in the GT++ quest tab.\n\n[warn]Don\u0027t use the NEI Preview for the Chemical Plant, it is wrong.[/warn]"
