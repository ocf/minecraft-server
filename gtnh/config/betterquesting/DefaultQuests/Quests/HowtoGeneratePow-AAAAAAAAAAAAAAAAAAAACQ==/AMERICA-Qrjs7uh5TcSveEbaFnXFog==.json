This is Americium Plasma, remember that!\n\nThis is actually the plasma that is probably the best choice for XL Plasma Turbines as a 1-recipe powergen setup. However, compared to Helium and Tin Plasma\u0027s previous state, it loses out a lot on speed on a mk3 compact, because it doesn\u0027t have the 192x/128x parallels, not to mention its recipe time is already 8x as long as Tin for the same amount of plasma. \n\nIt will also demand huge amount of Pu-241 for a UEV/UIV base to be sustained, but this fusion chain greatly reduces the amount needed, even if both inputs actually need Pu-241.\n\nThis step takes more than half the time of the final step, so it\u0027s one of the major bottlenecks: if you upgrade the final step to a compact, you would need 37 mk3 reactors to match speed here."
