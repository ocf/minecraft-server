First, right-click a network to select it. At first you\u0027ll see everything, but you can change the modes by holding shift and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down to see different things. Remember that if you have a subnetwork, like one that P2P tunnels go through for example, those nodes won\u0027t show up since it\u0027s a different network, but the P2P tunnels entrances and exits will. This goes through solid objects, so you can look at your whole base."
