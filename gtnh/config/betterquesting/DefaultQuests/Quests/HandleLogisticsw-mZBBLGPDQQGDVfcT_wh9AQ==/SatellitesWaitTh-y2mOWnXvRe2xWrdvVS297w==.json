You don\u0027t really want the items to just zoom around the pipes while waiting for the machine to make room... You want to have a big chest buffering items to be processed.\n\nIntroducing the Satellite Logistics Pipes. It provides additional input into the recipe incorporating it.\n\nThe pipe runs on a numerical frequency system, with the whole server sharing the number pool. This ensures that 2 separate systems can be connected to each other without conflict.\n\nYou can \"connect\" a crafting module with one satellite pipe by selecting the correct frequency of the satellite part. Multiple modules can connect to a single satellite pipe.\n\nSatellite pipe inputs are the 3 grey slots on the right of the 9 slots of the module. Only items in the 3 grey slots will be sent to satellite pipes.\n\nÂ§cNote: Ensure your satellite pipe has any frequency other than 0. A satellite pipe with frequency 0 will not work."
