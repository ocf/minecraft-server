For the Bats, just place them beneath you and AFK if your warp is high enough to spawn bats, otherwise...uh, go caving?\n\nFor the Slimes, if you can\u0027t find any just use the Maze Slimes from the Minoshroom maze in the Twilight Forest for this. After you get them, also go collect a Wolf and an Ocelot (Lassos or Soul Vials are great for this).\n\nNow we\u0027ll be creating new life, specifically Toads and Owls. Arrange a Cobweb above a water block with grasspers at the diagonals and one of the two sets of snares in the cardinal directions. Place Attuned Stone (Charged) in one of the Grasspers, and Mutandis Extremis in the other 3. Then place one of the two animals in the center and right-click with your Mutating Sprig like when making the snares. Use the Wolf with the Bats, and the Ocelot with the Slimes. The tamed versions also work.\n\nCongratulations, you\u0027ve defied the natural order and created new life! Hopefully they didn\u0027t run away because you created them outside :(\n\nMake sure to breed them for the next part. Use Raw Porkchop or Raw Beef for Owls, and Rotten Flesh for Toads to both tame and breed them."
