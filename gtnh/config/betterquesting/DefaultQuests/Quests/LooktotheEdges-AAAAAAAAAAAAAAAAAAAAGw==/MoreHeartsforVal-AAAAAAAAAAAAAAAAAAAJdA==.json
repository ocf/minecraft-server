First, make the Polynesia Charm that allows you to trade with animals (probably not worth it in this pack), then use the demon heart to make the Devil\u0027s Tongue Charm. With this, not only are they a lot less likely to attack, they will even sell their brethren\u0027s hearts for a little less.\n\nJust remember that it can only be used a limited number of times, ok? It might also be worthwhile to use the Rite of Protection at the same time as summoning a demon. To do so just put down both circles, and meet the item (and Altar Power) requirements of both. If you\u0027re not planning on killing the demon, you should probably send it back when you\u0027re done with the Rite of Banishing on page 47/48 of the Circle Magic book."
