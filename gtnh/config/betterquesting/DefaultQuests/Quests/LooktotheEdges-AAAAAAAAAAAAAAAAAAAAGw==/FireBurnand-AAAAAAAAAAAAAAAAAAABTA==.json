Activating the oven to show the interface screen, you will see an additional slot to the right of the fuel slot. Clay jars must be placed in this slot. If there are clay jars present when something is cooked, there is a chance a by-product will be captured in one of the jars. These by-products are important ingredients in other recipes. If there are no clay jars in the oven when something is cooked, no by-products will be produced.\n\nUpgrading an Oven\n\nAn oven can be upgraded by placing either a Fume Funnel or a Filtered Fume Funnel to the left and right of it. Each Fume Funnel will increase the cooking speed by an additional 10 percent (over a furnace) and increase the chance of a by-product being produced by an additional 25 percent for a Fume Funnel or 30 percent for a Filtered Fume Funnel.\n\nA fully upgraded oven will therefore cook at 130 percent speed (compared to a furnace) and have a 90 percent chance of producing a by-product."
