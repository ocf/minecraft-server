This will allow it to overclock like every other multi with 2x Speed and 4x EU/t.\n\nI will need to provide some distilled water to its hatch to absorb any excess heat.\n\n[note]The Liquid Cooling Tower allows the Multiblock to have 2/4 OC at the cost of 10L/s of distilled water when running. The input hatch is placed in the bottom center of the Liquid Cooling Tower.[/note]"
