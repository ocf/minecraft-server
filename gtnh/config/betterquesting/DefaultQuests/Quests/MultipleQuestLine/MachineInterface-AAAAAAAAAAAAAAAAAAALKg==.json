Just click on the fluid while holding a cell or other fluid container item.\n\nPoints to consider:\n1) Left click to attempt filling/emptying all fluid containers held on cursor.\n2) Right click to attempt filling/emptying one fluid container held on cursor.\n3) All fluid containers that can be used in a standard gt tank (e.g. super tanks or the X voltage tanks) are supported, including but not limited to: water bottles, vanilla buckets, ic2 (universal and normal) cells, volumetric flasks, large fluid cells, pressurized fluid tanks, etc.\n4) Can fill/take less than one cell (1000L or 144L if molten) of fluid if the fluid container supports doing so.\n5) It won\u0027t check if it\u0027s a valid fluid for the machine/recipe, keep that in mind.\n6) Doesn\u0027t work with Crops++ alcohols, feel free to code compatibility for us.\n7) EIO tanks need to be placed and picked up first before they can be used."
